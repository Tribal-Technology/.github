1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the repository you want to contribute to and create a local clone on your development machine.

2. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch for your contribution. It's recommended to give your branch a descriptive name that reflects the nature of your contribution.

3. **Make Changes**: Make the necessary changes in your local branch according to the contribution you want to make. Ensure that your changes adhere to our coding style, guidelines, and best practices.

4. **Commit and Push**: Once you have made your changes, commit them with a clear and descriptive commit message. Push your changes to your forked repository.

5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Submit a pull request from your forked repository to the original repository. Provide a detailed description of your changes, including any relevant information for reviewers.

 will be merged into the main project repository.

## Code Contribution Guidelines

When making code contributions to Tribal Tech projects, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Read the Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with the project's documentation, including the contributing guidelines, coding style, and development workflow. This will help you understand the project's requirements and ensure your contribution aligns with the project's goals.

2. **Create Small and Focused Pull Requests**: It's generally easier to review and merge small, focused pull requests. Try to isolate your changes to a specific feature, bug fix, or improvement. This makes the review process more efficient and increases the likelihood of your contribution being accepted.

3. **Write Clean and Readable Code**: Follow the project's coding style and conventions. Ensure that your code is well-documented, includes appropriate comments, and follows best practices. Writing clean and readable code not only helps reviewers and maintainers but also contributes to the long-term maintainability of the project.

4. **Write Tests**: Whenever possible, include tests for your code changes. Tests help ensure the stability and reliability of the project. They also serve as documentation and provide examples of how to use the code correctly.

5. **Keep Commit History Clean**: Make sure your commits have clear and descriptive messages. Each commit should represent a logical change and be self-contained. Squash or rebase your commits when necessary to maintain a clean commit history.

6. **Be Respectful and Constructive**: When engaging in discussions or receiving feedback, be respectful and considerate towards others. Provide constructive criticism and avoid personal attacks or offensive language. Remember that we are a community working together towards a common goal.

## Documentation Contribution Guidelines

When contributing to documentation, follow these guidelines:

1. **Proofread and Clarify**: Review the existing documentation for errors, typos, or unclear instructions. Make necessary corrections to ensure accuracy and clarity.

2. **Add Examples and Tutorials**: Enhance the documentation by adding practical examples, step-by-step tutorials, or sample code snippets. These additions can greatly assist users in understanding and using the project effectively.

3. **Improve Structure and Organization**: If you notice that the documentation could benefit from better organization or restructuring, propose improvements to enhance readability and accessibility.

4. **Include References and External Links**: When appropriate, include references to relevant external resources, articles, or documentation that can provide additional context or help users delve deeper into the topic.

## Issue Reporting Guidelines

When reporting issues, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Check for Duplicates**: Before submitting a new issue, search the issue tracker to check if a similar issue has already been reported. If you find an existing issue, you can provide additional information or show your support by adding relevant comments.

2. **Provide Reproducible Examples**: When reporting a bug or issue, include a minimal and reproducible example that demonstrates the problem. This helps maintainers understand and diagnose the issue more effectively.

3. **Include System Information**: Provide details about your operating system, software versions, and any other relevant system information that can help in identifying and resolving the issue.

4. **Be Specific and Descriptive**: Clearly describe the issue, including steps to reproduce it, expected behavior, and any error messages or warnings encountered. The more details you provide, the easier it will be for maintainers to understand and address the problem.
